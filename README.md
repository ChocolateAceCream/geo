# geo
ror backend to support geo data CURD

## api endpoints
Please refer to the api.md for details. Or if you want to try to send request to endpoints, use api.html.
Both files are generated by ApiFox, my personal favorite replacement for postman.

P.S.
GET and DELETE required params to be encoded like this
```js
// first wrap in an json object
let params = {
  "host":"google.com"
}
url = actualEndpointUrl + '?params=' + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(params))
```
`http://52.52.54.255:3000/geolocations?params=%7B%22host%22%3A%22google.com%22%7D`

## Deployment
I use docker & docker-compose to deploy the app.

First clone the repo in your local machine, then run
> sudo docker-compose up -d

in the root dir of the repo, which will run app in production mode.

I also deployed it in my EC2 host:
http://52.52.54.255:3000/geolocations

Remember to change the IPSTACK_ACCESS_KEY env variable in docker-compose.yml to your own, since mine can only send 100 request for free.

## Logs
If deployed in docker, logs are under /docker/log folder.

## TODO
Usually I like to wrap my response like this:
```json
{
  "errorCode": 0,
  "msg": "success",
  "data":{}
}

{
  "errorCode": 1,
  "msg": "fail",
}
```
So frontend can handle errors in the global response interceptor, raise up an error message or something.



# Dev Logs
I like to write daily logs!

Fresh new start, haven't touch rails/ruby for a long time, kinda miss the joy writing ruby codes. No matter what, ruby is the first language I picked up in my programming road path.

First thing first, setups
- [x] init project
- [x] init git
- [x] init db
- [x] setup docker
- [x] rspec

WOW, rails 7 and ruby 3! Still remember first time started a rails project, I was using rails 4 and ruby 1.x. How time flies.

Luckily I still have ruby/rails installed in my wsl, but not sure why when I init the project, I'm seeing this:
> Ignoring nokogiri-1.15.5 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine nokogiri --version 1.15.5
Ignoring nokogiri-1.10.10 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine nokogiri --version 1.10.10

might because I haven't used it for a long time.
gpt told me to run
> gem pristine nokogiri --version 1.10.10

to fix the issue, and it works

***P.S.***
Talking about AI and chatgpt, it's a grate tool to use, pretty much replaced google search. Our human brains have memory limits, and it erased unimportant stuff by nature.

### DB
I looked up geo data format, did not see any strong relations exists, so I plan to use mongodb to store the data.
For convenience, I just gonna use docker and docker-compose for a mongodb service
Also, using mongoid means I don't need to use active record.

### Rspec
TDD is common approach in rails. Remember when I first learning rails, every books/tutorials/blogs using TDD. However, late when I work as a developer, I always write test last, because of the tight schedule.

Setup rspec with mongoid-rspec gem and mongoid is straightforward. Only thing I noticed is that rspec is using ruby 2.7 right now.

Pretty much setup everything today, let's call it a night

## 2024-08-16
Plan for today
- [x] geolocation api endpoint (get, post, delete)
- [x] testing and test data preparation
- [ ] documentation
- [ ] docker

I don't plan to implement auth, that's something api gateway should do.

After writing go for years and switch back to ruby, I now appreciate how go handle errors. The way go handle errors forced developers to think ahead of the logic implementation and deal with error first.

Back to the system design. I think a tricky question I faced right now is how to deal with ip and hostname. There might be a chance that different hostname (like sub domain) may point to the same ip address. I have two options to handle this situation:
1. use an array to hold all hostname that point to that ip address. However, I need to be careful when add new record with hostname, I will need to remove that hostname from any existing record's hostname array first (if ip is not the same).
2. add a new field 'host', which can either be ip or hostname.
First approach will save storage space but add computation overhead, second one is versa vice

I will go with second approach for now, since it's logic is more straightforward.

After setup some test cases and endpoints, the project functionality almost done!

Gonna finish the document and deployment tomorrow. After all, it's Friday night!

Plan for today
- [x] docker
- [x] documentation

Done!
